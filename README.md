### Hi!

I am systems Engineer from Colombia with more than 10 years of experience in software development. Responsible, adaptable, with good management of interpersonal relationships and continuously acquiring new knowledge.

During my years of experience I have worked on projects related with banking, accounting, electronic commerce, IP telephony and education, where I have appropriated skills such as assertive communication, teamwork and leadership.

I have interest in DevOps, software architecture and development; I handle programming languages â€‹â€‹such as PHP (with the Laravel framework), Javascript (with the Angular, ReactJS framework), C/C++, Java (with the Play framework), Ruby (with the Ruby on Rails framework), as well as databases. SQL/NoSQL data, TDD application, SCRUM and application containerization with Docker.
